                                                The ChemSW NBT platform uses a Windows program to poll electronic balances connected to local machines by serial port. The Balance Reader Client (BRC) program makes this balance available for reading to any user logged into the ChemSW Live platform. As long as this program is left running on the balance's computer, it is possible to read the weight on this balance from any computer connected to ChemSW Live.
